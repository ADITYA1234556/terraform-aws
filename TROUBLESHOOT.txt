MY TEMPLATES SCRIPT THAT INITIALIZES DATABASE WAS FAILING BECAUSE THE MYSQL-CLIENT WAS NOT GETTING LOCATED.
SO I RAN SUDO APT UPDATE USING IF CONDITION UNTIL THE MYSQL-CLIENT GETS INSTALLED.

ALSO IN MY CODE EDITOR CHAGED THE CRLF (CARRIAGE RETURN + LINE FEED) FOR WINDOWS ENV. TO LF (LINE FEED) FOR UNIX ENV.
NOW MY APT UPDATE COMMANDS RAN ON UNIX ENV AND DIDNT CAUSE ANY ISSUES.
